# 🌍 Climate Credit Score Engine

AI-Powered Climate Risk Intelligence Platform for Financial Institutions & Borrowers

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Climate Credit Score Engine** is a full-stack climate risk assessment platform that evaluates how environmental and climate factors impact property-based lending decisions.

The system analyzes a property’s geographic location using climate models and generates a **Climate Credit Score**, helping banks, lenders, and investors make smarter, climate-aware financial decisions.

This project combines:

- 🌱 ClimateTech
- 💰 FinTech
- 🤖 AI Analytics

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional credit scoring ignores climate risks such as:

- Flood exposure
- Heat waves
- Sea-level rise
- Storm frequency
- Environmental degradation

These hidden risks create financial instability for lenders.

👉 Our solution introduces a **Climate Credit Score** to quantify environmental risk.
